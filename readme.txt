== Description ==
Display custom post type locations on an interactive Mapbox map with live user tracking and spoken navigation. The plugin uses Advanced Custom Fields for latitude and longitude values. A debug panel and elevation profile can be enabled from the settings screen. Spoken directions work with the system voices installed on the device, and a language selector allows the user to choose the desired voice.

2. Activate the plugin through the WordPress **Plugins** menu.
3. Enter your Mapbox access token under **Settings > GN Mapbox**.
4. Place the `[gn_map]` shortcode on any page.
