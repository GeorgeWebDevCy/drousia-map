# GN Mapbox Locations with ACF

This WordPress plugin displays custom post type locations on a Mapbox map. It allows visitors to view markers, follow routes and even get spoken navigation.

## Features
- Custom post type for locations
- Map display via shortcode `[gn_map]`
- Navigation panel with voice directions
- Route animation and elevation chart
- Optional debug panel
- **Offline map caching** (new in 2.6.0)
- Upload a photo gallery for each location

## Installation
1. Upload the plugin to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate it through the WordPress "Plugins" screen.
3. Enter your Mapbox access token in **Settings â†’ GN Mapbox**.

## Usage
Create `Map Location` posts with latitude and longitude fields and place the `[gn_map]` shortcode on any page.

## Offline Caching
A service worker caches Mapbox tiles for offline use once a page has been loaded online. The map will then continue working with the cached tiles when the network is unavailable.

## Default Locations
If no `Map Location` posts are found, coordinates are loaded from `data/locations.json`. Update this file to change the built-in locations.

## Changelog
### 2.7.0
- Added photo gallery support for locations

### 2.6.0
- Added offline map caching using a service worker
- Updated documentation
